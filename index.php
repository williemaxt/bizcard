          <h1>What Is Jungo</h1>
          <p>Jungo is an innovative modern way of how we have traditionally connected for centuries. After interactions people leave a card to be remembered, to establish a connection and to be contacted in the future. Business cards allow for professionalism and valuable relationships that can help to grow business. Jungo is a way that modernizes that traditional human exchange and makes the entire process more convenient in the digital world. With Jungo users can create a custom online paperless business card that can be shared with others phone to phone. Once connection has been established all the contact information can be saved into a business separate contact book. Never have to carry a stack of business cards in your pocket. Never will you have to receive a handful of business cards with no clue who everyone is. Never lose cards again. Never have to input cards into your phone. All your professional contacts in one place that can be found when you need them.  </p>
