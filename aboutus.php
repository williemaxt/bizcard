          <h1>How We Got Started</h1>
          <p>We had different reasons for coming together to create Jungo but practically the same idea in mind. It took a matter of minutes for the idea to formula into us discussing and  strategizing a plan to turn the idea into a reality. We immediately reached to make sure there is not a similar product then hopped on a call with a software developer to double check. Frankie’ s main goal is to my networking as simplistic and efficient as possible. Austin’s main goal for this app was to allow him to efficiently and effectively be able to separate personal from professional, while at the same time increase professional production.  Together we hope to innovate the way people  network not only professionally but eventually even socially and make  networking easier and stress free. </p>

I’m able to educate, learn and  sometimes even help others find a sense of  financial security. What could get better than that”.
